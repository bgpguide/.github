## About Us
bgpguide is a community-driven organization dedicated to improving general knowledge, fostering collaboration, and enhancing network accessibility. We believe in the power of education and open-source collaboration to drive positive change in the tech community.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to empower individuals by providing them with the knowledge and resources they need to succeed in their respective fields. We strive to create a culture of continuous learning and growth through our various initiatives and projects.

## What We Do
At bgp.guide, we engage in a range of activities to achieve our mission:

1. **Community IRRd Servers**: We operate and maintain community IRRd servers that are accessible for anyone to use. These servers play a critical role in validating and documenting routing policies, ensuring the smooth functioning of networks.

2. **Education and Guides**: We provide comprehensive educational resources and guides on our website to help individuals understand and utilize tools such as Internet Routing Registries (IRRs) and Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). Our friendly guides offer practical insights, best practices, and step-by-step instructions to empower network administrators and operators.

3. **Validation and Testing**: We actively validate and test networks to ensure they are user-friendly and accessible, particularly for novice users. By prioritizing user-centric design and ease of use, we aim to lower barriers to entry and create inclusive environments for network users.

4. **Open-Source Collaboration**: We actively contribute to the open-source community through our GitHub projects. By collaborating with developers worldwide, we strive to push the boundaries of innovation, share knowledge, and create valuable resources for the wider tech community.
